## AIM:
To write a python program for copying the contents from one file to another file.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 

### Step 1:

Use open function to open the file in which we want to copy from and access it in read mode.

###Step 2:

Read the file and store in a variable.

###Step 3:

Now create a new file in which we want to paste the content using write access mode.

###Step 4:

Use write function to copy the read file that has been stored in the variable.

###Step 5:

The content in the original file will be copied in the new file.

###Step 6:

End the program.
